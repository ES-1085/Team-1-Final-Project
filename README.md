This project aims to visualize the climate change induced increase in natural disaster frequency over the last century or so. We created a handful of visualizations that illuminate this trend and included info on the breakdown of natural disaster types by continent, as well as a continent's Community Preparedness Index (CPI). 

We created an informative handout that will help inform a reader about some of the trends and nuances of natural disaster data over the last hundred years. We used R studio for coding and the creation of plots, Kaggle for the natural disasters dataset, and Canva to create the handout. 
  
We are well aware that the dataset provided does not take into account the selective book keeping of natural disasters, and we are not suggesting that the figures provided are a comprehensive picture of the way natural disasters have impacted communities over the last century.

Thanks so much,
